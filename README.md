## Browse Swift Repos on GitHub

A simple application that lists public Swift repositories on Github using Githubs public API.

It consists of two screens, a list of repos with endless scrolling and a detail view with stats information.

This project used to be a SwiftUI playground and has now been reshaped into a modular app, to lear about micro-apps architecture.
